<h1>Friendly (and helpful) Faces</h1>

<p>There are literally HUNDREDS of Friendly Faces at Indy Hall. One thing this community isn't short on is smiles. </p>

<p>If you're just getting started, you might not be sure who you can turn to for help. In this part of the guide, we'll profile some people that you should <strong>absolutely</strong> get to know, but please please please please please don't stop with them. </p>

<h4>Karina - <a href="http://twitter.com/karinaclough">@karinaclough</a>
</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/images/karina.png" class="photo-right"></p>

<p><strong>Before I joined Indy Hall, I:</strong> Worked in an insurance brokers office while event planning and organizing for various non profits on the side. Prior to joining Indy Hall, I realized how much I love and have a passion for the Philadelphia community especially the sustainability movement. </p>

<p><strong>One thing I like to teach people is:</strong> "In the time of your life, live—so that in that wondrous time you shall not add to the misery and sorrow of the world, but shall smile to the infinite delight and mystery of it." -William Saroyan  </p>

<p><strong>One of my dreams is:</strong> To become an United States citizen and travel the world with my husband. </p>

<h4>Adam - <a href="http://twitter.com/adjoterus">@adjoterus</a>
</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/images/adam.png" class="photo-right"></p>

<p><strong>Before I joined Indy Hall, I:</strong> produced copy for social media campaigns at a local agency, wrote 50% of several jokes before abandoning the premise for each.</p>

<p><strong>One thing I like to teach people is:</strong> "Friends are friends because they've discovered how much they have in common. Opponents, adversaries, and foes are friends too, who have not yet discovered this." [via Notes from the Universe]</p>

<p><strong>One of my dreams is:</strong> to erase that token cynicism from Philadelphia's repertoire. I'm deeply proud of my peers, my coworkers, and my neighbors. These people are my friends, these people are my home - and there's no room for apathy in our city.</p>

<h4>Alex - <a href="http://twitter.com/alexknowshtml">@alexknowshtml</a>
</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/images/alex.png" class="photo-right"></p>

<p><strong>Before I joined Indy Hall, I:</strong> was a freelance web developer working from home. I loved my work, but hated being alone.</p>

<p><strong>One thing I like to teach people is:</strong> how to accomplish big things by starting small. </p>

<p><strong>One of my dreams is:</strong> to make the world better by helping people be happy and fulfilled while working together.</p>

<h4>Geoff- <a href="http://twitter.com/geoffd">@geoffd</a>
</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/images/geoff.png" class="photo-right"></p>

<p><strong>Before I co-founded Indy Hall, I:</strong> Worked at Rolling Stone, was a multimedia professor at UArts, played lots of ultimate, and had two kids.</p>

<p><strong>One thing I like to teach people is:</strong> How to run a business.</p>

<p><strong>One of my dreams is:</strong> Is to see I-95 removed from Philadelphia to reconnect the waterfront to all of us.</p>

<h2 id="2___Regulars_">2. "Regulars"</h2>

<p>Indy Hall can feel a bit like "Cheers" sometimes - and like the show, we've got a cast of characters who have been around long enough to know a little bit more about Indy Hall than the average coworker. These folks have helped out a little extra, know lots of other members well, and know lots of "hidden tips" and stories about Indy Hall.</p>

<p>Getting to know even a couple of these members can be a fast-track to connecting to the community. Pick one (or more!) and say hi.</p>

<h4>Sean Martorana</h4>

<p>Sean has been a part of the Indy Hall family for a long time, but since 2009 has become best known for making and curating most of the art that you see around Indy Hall, and is one of lead curators of <a href="http://twitter.com/indyhall_arts">Indy Hall Arts</a>. Want to find out more about the art programming at Indy Hall, or interested in seeing some of your or your friends' art on the walls? Say hi to Sean.</p>

<h4>Johnny Bilotta</h4>

<p>Johnny might be considered "patient zero" at Indy Hall - he was among the first people who jumped on board our community building efforts back before we had a coworking space to call our own. Johnny knows lots about Indy Hall's history. He also knows a lot about beer. And he's a helluva designer. You can ask him just about anything about any of those three things.</p>

<h4>Kara LaFleur</h4>

<p>Kara is another Indy Hall OG - but with a twist. These days, she's spending less time behind a computer screen as an interactive producer and more time behind a cutting board. She hosts Dinner Club during Night Owls every wednesday. Does she make websites or food? She'll probably tell you the answer is "both".</p>

<h4>Dana Henry</h4>

<p>Dana joined Indy Hall a couple of years ago to escape the isolation of being a freelance writer - a talent which she has pursued with local publications including Grid Magazine and Flying Kite. You're most likely to meet Dana at one of the weekly events that she diligently leads, including Night Owls every week on Wednesdays after 6, Member Lunches every Friday from 1-2pm.</p>

<h4>Rob Epler</h4>

<h4>Eric Steele</h4>

<h4>Nicole Freyer</h4>

<h4>Parker Whitney</h4>
