First and foremost, thanks for accepting our invitation to be a member of Indy Hall. We're glad you're here.\n\nWhen I started down the path of creating Indy Hall, it wasn't because I needed a place to work - even though I loved the freedom and flexibility to work from anywhere, I was lonely working by myself. If you're here for similar reasons (and there's a good chance you are), we're already helping each other.\n\nMany years later, Indy Hall has evolved into an unusual, exceptional, unpredictable, and wonderful place - but you probably already know that, because you've made the decision to be a part of our community.\n\nOne of the things that's always been remarkable to me about Indy Hall's growth and evolution, from our initial 20 members to the 200+ member community we are today, is that the culture of this community is still as strong as it was the first day, if not stronger for our size.\n\nHow to use this Guide\n\nEven more remarkable is that we've accomplished this without a written \"rulebook\" for our members. \n\nI've often joked that part of the reason we don't have a rulebook is because \"I like being able to change things as we go\". There's more than a bit of truth in that, and in fact, I believe that we need to be able to change things as we go. Once we write down an answer, people tend to stop exploring new possibilities (accepting things as status quo is something that Our Virtues guide us away from). \n\nBut one of the other things that has allowed Indy Hall to evolve successfully is listening with an open mind. While reading this thread on our discussion list, my eyes were opened to the need for more \"guidance systems\" to help Indy Hall members feel comfortable and confident in our community. \n\nA new kind of challenge\n\nWhile creating this guide, we asked ourselves the question: \n\n\nHow do we create a resource that gives answers, but also explains how we came up with those answers and encourages members to explore new possible answers?\n\n\nThe result is a guide that is a mix of story, dialogue, introspection, ideas, and tools to help you be an excellent community member at Indy Hall - and ultimately, in any setting where you gather, meet, work, and collaborate.\n\nMake It Better\n\nMost importantly, this guide is co-created by you - the members of Indy Hall.\n\nYou're invited - and encouraged - to push boundaries, explore new options, find new (and better!) answers to any questions about how to succeed as a member, and how to help this community succeed. \n\nYou can even contribute directly to the guide with additional/revised text, photos, stories, links, blog posts, etc. Read our how to section on How To Contribute to this Guide to find out more.\n\nThis is a map, not a manual. We need your contributions.\n\nThis document isn't written in stone. While every line is there for a reason, every line is also an invitation to talk about it. We warmly welcome conversation, debate, and experimentation. \n\nIf you want to share with the entire community, start a new discussion on GroupBuzz. \n\nIf you prefer to start the conversation privately, you can email help@indyhall.org to reach Alex, Adam, and Karina directly.\n\nLook for TODOs\n\nThroughout these pages, you may notice a section or feature that is clearly incomplete. Often, it will be denoted by a line prefixed \"TODO:\" followed by a description of what's expected to follow. \n\nIf you find a TODO that you'd like to complete and contribute, go for it! Our guide for making contributions will show you a handful of easy ways to turn a TODO into a DONE.\n\nAdd your voice\n\nWanna help make this page better?

Most people here do not work together on the same projects or businesses. So what brings us together as a community?\n\nWhen we look beyond the work that we do and the titles we hold, we start to notice the experiences we've lived and the passions we hold.\n\nBula, who has been an Indy Hall member since September of 2009, once said to me:\n\n\n\"Indy Hall has people from a breadth of experiences, from all walks of life. \n\nHere, you get people...and not just what they're doing now, and today.\nYou get people and their histories\".\n\n\nAnd if we challenge ourselves to look even deeper than those experiences and passions, we find what really glues us together: the core values and virtues that we practice as individuals and as a community. \n\nIt's not easy, but we do our best to think about these values and virtues every day. Even at an operations level, we use the values and virtues as tools for making decisions about how Indy Hall runs.\n\nOur Values\n\nWe subscribe to the 5 core values shared by the global Coworking movement: Sustainability, Accessibility, Openness, Collaboration, & Community.\n\nBelow is a series of essays by Indy Hall co-founder Alex Hillman explaining how we think about and practice these core values at Indy Hall. \n\n\nNote: These essays have been adapted for the \"How To Indy Hall guide\", but each essay in its original form can be found on his personal blog, and have even been translated into other languages, including French and Portuguese!\n\n\nSustainability\n\nSustainability is a loaded word.\n\nThe \"green\" benefits of Indy Hall are obvious: resource sharing is inherently green, as is commute reduction. \n\nBut the reality is that, in a modern society, does \"being a responsible eco-citizen\" belong in the list of top line core values? Efficiency is a benefit, but not a core value. Striving for efficiency is a good goal, but it's rarely a source of greatness.\n\nSo if sustainability doesn't mean \"going green\", what does it mean?\n\nSustainability, in my mind, is about making sure that whatever you're doing can be done for as long as it needs to be done. \n\nA Farmer Once Told Me\n\nI had the pleasure of seeing Joel Salatin speak at TEDxMidAtlantic in 2009, and remember being struck by what this farmer had to say. I highly recommend his 15 minute talk.\n\nA community that can feed itself is free. A community that cannot feed itself is not. It's that simple.— Joel Salatin (@JoelSalatin) July 25, 2011\nJoel's tweet above is about food. But if you read past the fact that he's talking about food, what he's really talking about is nourishment.\n\nHow Indy Hall became sustainable\n\nIn the early days of Indy Hall, Geoff and I were talking about how to take the momentum we'd built and turn it into the coworking space that everybody wanted. \n\nOne of the important insights Geoff drove home was that we needed to be able to sustain ourselves – our membership should support costs as well as provide room for growth – or else it wouldn't worth building the infrastructure in the first place. It wouldn't be sustainable.\n\nWe looked at for profit and non-profit models, and determined that in order for us to achieve that goal, for us to be sustainable, being a for-profit business provided for us most effectively for two reasons: speed and agility. As a for-profit LLC, we could stay lightweight and agile, but still remain benevolent and community focused. \n\nMore importantly, we didn't (and still don't) have to answer to investors or banks or anybody besides ourselves. \n\nMost importantly, we could answer to the most important people: our community. We could focus on growing in a way that depends on no one except for the people who benefit most from the resources we rally.\n\nAfter all, community that isn't able to nourish itself lives in dependency of whomever is providing for it, and therefore is not only not free, but not sustainable.\n\nIndy Hall is a community that is able to provide for itself and doesn't exclude itself from external sources of nourishment – but it remains free, sustainable, and independent.\n\nThe people and businesses we support will live as our reflections.\n\nI firmly believe that the longer Indy Hall is able to do what it does best, the healthier the people and businesses who work from it will be. We see our members often gain sustainability by:\n\n\nunderstanding your identity, who you are (not just who you aren't).\nparticipating in a support network for growth.\nengaging in the open and honest exchange of information and ideas.\npracticing humility taught by not having to be the smartest kid in the room.\nreintroducing  natural relationship formation into business deal workflow.\n\n\nThese are all things that are necessary to \"heal the world\", just as much as the elements of \"going green\" are.\n\nIf we're healing the planet for people who aren't living and working sustainably, what's the point?\n\n\nYou might enjoy another great essay on the core value of sustainability from a coworking space in Frederick, Maryland.\n\n\nAccessibility\n\nWe trust people to select themselves in. One of the unique elements of Indy Hall is that anybody who can work from anywhere can become a member of this community. You don't even need to physically be here to be a part of it. A key element here is self-selection.\n\nIf you think about it, it's actually pretty remarkable. Indy Hall is one of the few places in the world where every single person in the room is there because they chose to be. An environment composed of willing, self-selected participants is a remarkably positive and productive place to work, as you'll find out talking to anybody who works or hangs out here. I think that many people who cite unusual productivity levels from working at Indy Hall are actually feeling the benefits of a) choosing for themselves where to work for the day and b) being surrounded by others who choose where they work for the day.\n\nOver the last 6 years, we've had many people surprise us. Maybe their experience level seemed lower than average. Maybe their social skills needed a little work. Maybe they were shyer. Maybe they were boisterous. Maybe they were snarky. Maybe they were know-it alls. In time, most of those attributes vanished. They started to be themselves, instead of the person they thought they had to be. And in the best cases, they improved themselves over time. \n\nIndy Hall, as a melting pot, allows all of these extremes to normalize on their own. We trust that when people have to actually deal with other people instead of have managers, mediators, or human resources solve their problems for them – most of the time, things work themselves out.\n\nWe trust people to select themselves out.\nIn the early days of Indy Hall, we were excited to be meeting anybody who wanted to be around. Not because we were desperate to fill our office, but because we were genuinely excited to be finding more and more people who were awesome.\n\nThen one day, somebody not so awesome showed up. I knew personal stories about this person, and decided that I didn't want that person around Indy Hall. I talked it over with Geoff, who was able to look at the situation without my biases:\n\n\n\"If we don't let in one person because you don't like them, what kind of precedent does that set for everybody else? We want Indy Hall to be a place where anybody – even people we don't know yet – can feel welcome, be a part of and contribute to something great.\"\n\n\nMy commitment to the core value of accessibility was being challenged.\n\nI had to trust that this person would make the right decision for themselves: either they would change their behavior from what I knew to have happened in the past (a positive outcome), or that they'd leave on their own when they realized they wouldn't get what they wanted (also a positive outcome).\n\nIf they were truly not aligned with our community as I expected, the latter was the most likely result.\n\nInside of a couple of months, that person simply stopped showing up on their own.\n\nThis interaction has happened more than once. On only two occasions in six years have we had to ask somebody to leave.\n\nBalance is key\n\nThe core value of accessibility relies on both of these dynamics to be in balance. Indy Hall's philosophy remains committed to this core value, the remarkable outcomes and benefits that make us more than a \"trendy way to share real estate\" start to take form.\n\nWhen everything shakes out, we're glad to be part of a unique environment where we can trust people to surprise us in a positive way.\n\nOpenness\n\nThe core value of openness may seem redundant after reading about accessibility, but the nuanced difference is an important one.\n\nI think Chris Messina says it best in this interview,\n\n\nOpenness is unfortunately one of those words that's become somewhat geriatric, losing its teeth and forgetting what it means...\n\nWhen I think of openness I also think of biology and the human body. The human body is an \"open system\" and thrives because of its openness. The human body is constantly exchanging things it values little for things it values more. Whether you're talking about oxygen and CO2 or nutrients and waste, the body cycles – value in and waste excreted. It requires openness to live.\n\n\nThe fact that Chris and other early coworking founders realized that by making coworking \"open\", that it could evolve into something much larger than any one of them could control – and that would ultimately be the best thing for the idea.\n\nOpenness comes into practice in two key ways at Indy Hall - freedom and forkability.\n\nFreedom\n\nIndy Hall embodies freedom and independence. We represent choice, the ultimate freedom. Coworking Seattle's about page says...\n\n\nCoworking is about making the personal choice to work along side other people instead of in isolation.\n\n\n\"Forkability\"\n\n\"Forkability\" is the ability to take the \"source\" of one project and use it to begin a new project. In software, the source is code. Here at Indy Hall, the source is lessons learned, ideas executed, and of course our core values and virtues.\n\nI've described Indy Hall as a \"blank canvas\" an office. \n\n\n\"What happens when you share basic office amenities only – desks, chairs, power, internet, meeting rooms, bathrooms – and let the people decide what's most important to them?\"\n\n\nMany interesting things happen, but the most important is the new possibility of making it you own.\n\nThe stories I tell of the cool things that happen at Indy Hall aren't things that Geoff or I go out of our way to make happen. The stories I tell of the cool things that happen at Indy Hall are all stories of our community, our members, who continually build on top of the basic infrastructure we share and maintain together.\n\nThe \"innovation\" that happens at Indy Hall is the result of an experience that it affords everyone here the opportunity to create new solutions to the problems they have rather than relying on the old solutions that haven't been working as well.\n\nAs a member of Indy Hall, you 're encouraged to \"fork\" Indy Hall, especially when the things you decide to do benefit other members in addition to yourself.\n\nCollaboration\n\nI like to remember this post about collaboration from Derek Neighbors of Gangplank in Arizona:\n\n\n\"You can't do collaboration, you have to be a collaborator.\"\n\n\nI find this idea poignant for a number of reasons – not the least of which is that it fits my own mental model for coworking so well. Coworking works because it throws away so many of the bad habits we've learned and puts the focus back on the people again.\n\nCollaboration isn't something you do.Collaboration is the by-product of being a better collaborator.\n\nTrust & High Contact\n\nWe talk a lot about trust, here. Indy Hall allows for there to be a focus on the formation of trust and deeper relationships between coworkers, because office politics, hierarchies, and succession planning are removed from the equation.\n\nGoing one step further, we create opportunities for people to interact in a \"high contact\" environment. The serendipitous nature of our clubhouse means that people are often spending far more face time with each other than in an office where people only interact when they need to.\n\nLearning by Example\n\nIndy Hall is a great place to learn how to be a better collaborator. \n\nWe believe that our members are collaborators, not customers. Members who work together – not just with each other but with the community and space itself – tend to have build deepest bonds with the community. \n\nLearning to Ride a Bike\n\nHere's a parable: \n\nDo you remember learning to ride a bike? Can you imagine learning to ride a bike alone? \n\nIt's a painful series of trials and errors. While you might've watched somebody else do it, you're likely to fall and scrape your knee on your first try. \n\nTeaching somebody to ride a bike, however, requires them to be a good collaborator more than it requires them to be a good teacher. They need to guide you, support you, and help you find your own \"balance\". It requires that the new rider trusts their instructor/collaborator, and spend a fair amount of time together.\n\nThe collaborators that work with, in and from Indy Hall are very similar. Good collaborators earn trust first. They spend a lot of face time together with their peers. They don't instruct, but instead guide, support, and help you find your own way.\n\nIn the best collaborator relationships, it's a two way street – each person has the ability to provide that experience for the other at some point in their time together.\n\nIndy Hall provides one of the best natural environments for this to happen.\n\n\nCommunity Tip: Learn the difference between \"trust\" and \"authority\"\n\nWant to be an awesome collaborator? Read this excellent guide on how to be a kick-ass community member for tips on building trust.\n\n\nCommunity\n\nI think community is my personal favorite of the coworking core values, and perhaps one of the most misunderstood or most often taken for granted.\n\nIt's easy to make mistakes around the idea of community. Experts in the field of sociology can't even agree on a definition, Wikipedia mentions that by the 1950′s there were nearly 100 \"discrete definitions\". Instead of getting mired in clinical discussion, there's one thing that matters:\n\nIt's about the people.\n\nIn the context of coworking, though, I believe that a focus on community means putting emphasis on people, their interactions, and the relationships that form between them above everything else. At Indy Hall, every decision we make considers each other as members, and the opportunities to interact with one another.\n\nWe > Me\n\nWe organize events and develop experiences that encourage each other to explore our shared interests in and outside of work. Show and Tell, Lunch & Learns, and Happy Hours provide a spectrum of formal and informal opportunities to step away from the desk and get to know another coworker.\n\nWe share rituals and experiences that allow new members to join our tribe and develop camaraderie.\n\nWe broadcast our favorite places to hang out outside of our clubhouse so that you can easily gather with other members on your own.\n\nWe attend and support other events and initiatives together (and we try to avoid rolling as a \"click\"), both enhancing them with the sense of \"togetherness\" that we bring but also showing the uninitiated that our \"togetherness\" is accessible to them .\n\nWe learn, share, grow, play, experiment, celebrate together. We commiserate and console each other as well.\n\nOur clubhouse is a tool\n\nOur coworking space is just that – a space. It's not a community without people in it.\n\nGeoff and I think about Coworking as a \"clubhouse\", and I think that language is more accurate of a description than \"office\". But it's important to remember that in order for a clubhouse to be useful, a club – a community – should be in need of a home.\n\n\nA side-note from Alex: I don't own a community, I belong to a community.\n\nI often say that I absolutely love that I can come to Indy Hall as a member, far more than I care about coming to Indy Hall as an owner. \nThe oft-forgotten truth is that coworking space owners can get the same benefits from coworking as the members do, mostly due to the fact that we ourselves are (or should be) good community members as well.\n\n\nCommunities of Trust\n\nIf relationships between members are like tendons, then trust is the the muscle that makes a community strong and healthy.\n\nWe start by trusting each other, and knowing that sets a stage where trust is a valued part of being in this community. When you start a relationship off on one where you don't trust others, you can't ever expect them to trust you, either.\n\nNo two communities are identical\n\nI wouldn't ever encourage somebody to replicate Indy Hall, nor do I think it's really replicate-able. Instead, I urge people to learn from the lessons we've learned, share some of our ideas, but interpret them to fit their community .\n\nI personally think that the coolest thing is that communities, like the people in them, have personality. Squelching that personality is a waste – instead, we embrace it. \n\nOur Virtues\n\n\nNote: the concepts and contents of this section about our virtues originated in this post on Alex's Blog - The Virtues of Indy Hall.\n\n\nEudaimonia\n\nThe Greeks had a word - eudaimonia - which translates to \"the good life\". More specifically, they described the good life as:\n\n\n\"...rich with relationships, ideas, emotion, health and vigor, recognition and contribution, passion and fulfillment, and great accomplishment and enduring achievement.\"\n\n\nArête\n\nThe Greeks had another word - Arête - which translates into \"virtues\".\n\n\nVirtues are patterns in how we behave - habits, choices, interactions, etc - that when practiced and matured bring the \"side effect\" of eudaimonia. \n\n\nBut virtues don't automatically result in \"the good life.\"\n\nThink of it like going to the gym: if you go to the gym to lose weight, you're likely to be disappointed or fall off the wagon if the weight loss doesn't show up as fast as you want.\n\nIf you go to the gym to be healthy, your motivators come from deeper inside of you, and you're more likely to push through the harder parts of the workout routine as you make progress with becoming healthier.\n\nWeight loss will be the byproduct of becoming healthier. The good life is a byproduct of practicing Arête every day.\n\nPracticing Arête requires a transformation in perspective:\n\n\nFrom vision to ambition.\nFrom mission to intention.\nFrom strategy to constraints.\nFrom objectives to imperatives.\n\n\nOur Ambition\n\nAn ambition replaces a \"vision\" – and it answers the question \"why are we here?\" \n\nMore specifically, an ambition is meant to define the kinds of returns we will create, and who will benefit. The more genuine the value is, the greater the ambition. \n\nWe earn bonus points for better, rather than bigger.\n\n\nOur ambition is to make Philadelphia (and ultimately the world) a better place to make a living doing what you love, creating space for trusting, lasting relationships between people before they need to work together.\n\n\nOur Intentions\n\nAn intention is an action required to achieve an ambition. \n\nHow do you improve things for the people you interact with? What interactions make sure the ambition is being fulfilled? We seek to:\n\n\n...help unlikely groups of likeminded people form relationships.\n...focus on people and their interactions, and the formation of relationships.\n...help people tell the stories of the experiences they have in Philadelphia.\n...trust people to do the right thing.\n...guide people to being good citizens of Indy Hall and of Philadelphia.\n...support people in their goals of building businesses to last, in Philadelphia and for Philadelphia.   \n\n\nOur Constraints\n\nConstraints are the actions which must not be done. Constraints exist to avoid things that do damage to the value being created. We must never:\n\n\n...do anything against our community's interest.\n...focus on desks or square footage.\n...create something only because we think we're supposed to.\n...accept the status quo.\n...accept a \"no\" at face value.\n...compromise our core values.\n...prioritize a transaction before a relationship.   \n\n\nOur Imperatives\n\nImperatives are the things that must be done daily. They're specific, focused actions that help achieve the intentions and ambitions. We must always:\n\n\n...keep people at the center of every action, interaction, and decision.\n...welcome new community members, and make it clear that Indy Hall is theirs, not just ours.\n...always look for a way to say \"yes\".\n...teach others in our immediate and neighboring communities how we operate.   \n\n\nDo It Yourself\n\nIf you're running a business, from startup to Fortune 500, you can practice Arête.\n\nIf you're developing a community, from a family to a city, you can practice Arête.\n\nIf you're creating, from art to technology, you can practice Arête.\n\nIf you're working, alone or as part of a team, you can practice Arête.\n\nIf your goals include doing things that are authentic and meaningful, you must practice Arête.\n\nWhat are your ambitions, intentions, constraints, and imperatives?\n\nAdd your voice\n\nWanna help make this page better?

We have a wider curiosity.\n\nWe are a gathering of people finding a way of working better together (both offline and on) focused on inspiration, participation and learning through doing. Anything can happen, the environments and space(s) change.\n\nThe participants of Indy Hall share a fundamental optimism, a spirit of liberty in action, encouragement and enlightenment. Where many people would see problems, Participants see opportunities for making things better, and they wish to take on a personal responsibility for making things happen.\n\nWe work to inspire anyone to help everyone.\nWe use creative intelligence to solve real problems.\n\n\nThis bit of text was borrowed and modified from our friends at CoFWD in Kent, UK. Special thanks to Carl Jeffrey for sharing with us.\n\n\nHow to be a kick ass community member\n\nBeing a great member of our community happens a bit differently than in some other  settings. It's more organic, less mechanical. This also means that often, it takes time. \n\nTrust is one of the primary currencies at Indy Hall, and it plays a big role in being a kick-ass community member.\n\nHere's an observation for consideration:\n\n\nIn order to help, someone needs to be ready to accept that help. \nIn order for people to be ready to accept help, they need to be able to be willing to be vulnerable enough to ask for help.\nBeing vulnerable requires establishing trust in the source. People are drawn to trusted sources, not authoritative sources\nThe difference between establishing authority and trust, in our experience, is being able to show some vulnerability yourself.\n\n\nSo with this chain of events in mind, sometimes the best way to be a PROVIDER of help is to first establish trust by receiving help rather than offering it. There are lots of ways to do that, of course, but the most effective ways tend to be small and personal rather than a blast to the entire community. \n\nIf a large portion of your participation in the community at Indy Hall will be online, you may find it effective earn trust by listening and engaging in conversations (all the while, remembering the difference between authority and trust mentioned above) rather than trying to jump-start them without that foundation of earned trust.\n\n\nCommunity Tip - Start Small\n\nTry framing it this way: instead of trying to help the \"members of Indy Hall\", focus on one building relationship at a time. Indy Hall is a special place where we try to make it easier to build the relationships before transactions.\n\n\nYour Responsibilities\n\nIndy Hall is quite different from your average working environment. Among the differences, we are not a serviced office, and that's not an accident. \n\nBeing a member of Indy Hall comes with the benefits of sharing ideas, information, support, and of course our coworking clubhouse. \n\nIn exchange, here is a non-exhaustive  the expectations that we have of all Indy Hall members, in taking care of each other:\n\n\nParticipation can be an extreme sport. If you break or lose it, you should replace it.\nYour equipment & professional liability is your responsibility.\nCleaning up after yourself, along with emptying trash & recycling when they are full is a shared responsibility. We work together to keep the space we're proud of presentable. Let a core team member know if you're not sure where empty bags are, or where trash goes.\nLeave any space you use as you found it or better than you found it. Artwork and decoration is welcome, we recommend working with Indy Hall Arts' lead curator Sean Martorana to make your installation look excellent.\nAnyone who behaves in an manner that is destructive to the space or other participants may be asked to leave.\nBe responsible and respectful using our internet. Bittorrent and porn are absolutely not allowed. Large (1GB+) downloads or uploads during business hours aren't strictly prohibited...but it's rude to hog bandwidth.\nRespect other peoples personal and business privacy, confidentiality, safety, property and data. If you're not sure, ask them.\nThe last remaining keyholder must ask a non-keyholder to leave at the end of the night, and non-keyholders must respect keyholders' personal schedules.\nThis bit of text was also borrowed and modified from our friends at CoFWD in Kent, UK.

Be sure to use the same email address you get Indy Hall emails from.\nYou should also add a brief bio about yourself on the \"Profile\" page in GroupBuzz.\n\n\nHall.com (ask for an invite)\n\n\n\nLog in, spend a few minutes reading some of the existing discussions to get a feel, and then introduce yourself! Say a bit about what why you joined Indy Hall, what things you're interested in (don't limit yourself to work topics, people love sharing personal interests and hobbies, too). \n\n\nCommunity Tip - What to post (and what not to post)\n\nIt's probably easier to mention posts that aren't successful or efficient: if it reads like a blog post, it likely won't be read well by members. Stay personal. Keep it real.\n\nRemember the difference between asking a friend for help and posting a recruiting email. Job listings are best to the \"Gig Swap\" room in Hall. \n\n\nCoworking Community\n\nEspecially when you're new, Indy Hall can be a lot to take in, and it's not always obvious where to start. \n\nIf you're overwhelmed, remember, you don't have to meet everybody at once. Stay focused on meeting one or two people at a time. \n\nWhen you sit down next to people you don't know, make eye contact and say hi, give them your name and ask for theirs. You can ask questions like, \"how long have you been a member?\" or \"Any tips for a newbie like me?\". \n\nEveryone here is interesting (even if they don't think so)! \n\nBe patient. Be curious. Be friendly. Be honest.\n\nAttending Events\n\nWeekly & Monthly Events\n\nThere are things to do with other Indy Hall members Indy Hall every week, including Working @ Night Owls & Dinner Club, joining in the conversation at Member Lunches, and Indy Hall Running Club, and B-Team trips to the comic book shop.   \n\nMonthly events include our ever-popular Show & Tell, various art openings, and happy hours. Over the course of the year, we also host several large parties that are open to the public. We're always looking for something to celebrate!   \n\nYou can find out about our planned event schedule by joining our Meetup Group: http://www.meetup.com/IndyHall/events/calendar/\n\n\"Everyday\" and impromptu events\n\nYou don't have to wait for an event to show up on the calendar. Every day at Indy Hall can be an event! \n\nBecause they're not on the calendar, you do need to keep your eyes open for improtpu gatherings in the kitchen, lounge, gallery, and other common areas. Also, keep an eye on GroupBuzz discussions & Hall chat for announcements. \n\n\nHave an idea for getting members together? Awesome!

Get meta and check out the guide on contributing to to this guide!\n\n\nGetting Started\n\nConnecting to Wifi\n\n\n\nUse the wireless connections named \"Indy Hall 2.4gHz\" and \"Indy Hall 5gHz\". \n\nAll of our wireless access points use the same password, which is included in your welcome email; ask your neighbor or one of the core team members if you’re having trouble connecting.\n\nWhat's the difference between the two networks available?\n\nMobile phones and tablets may only show 2.4gHz as an option, but if you see both options you can pick whichever one has the strongest signal. 5gHz may be noticeably faster for some high-demand uses, but your milage may vary.\n\n\nCommunity Tip - Ask a neighbor\n\nJoin the \"Indy Hall 2.4gHz\" network if you're not sure, and ask anyone for the password.\n\n\nFinding a seat\n\n\nImportant note #1\n\nHopefully, one of the reasons that you joined Indy Hall is to break away from the loneliness that happens when you work alone. So one of our #1 pieces of advice is: don't sit alone! \n\nImportant note #2\n\nChoosing a place to sit is NOT permanent! You can swap seats with another member any time you want (you'll want to talk to them about it first, naturally) and every few months, we do a \"reset\" that allows people to move around, try new areas, and make new deskmates. \n\n\nWith these notes in mind, you can sit almost anywhere you like! We've done a little bit of extra work to help you enjoy the time you spend coworking with us the most. Those color coded workclusters with light and dark surfaces aren't arranged that way because we wanted it to look like a checkerboard (though the look is cool, isn't it?). We do that to help you mix and mingle easier. Here's how it works!\n\nFor Full Time Members:\n\nFull-Time members are encouraged, but not required, to find an available dark colored desk to set up shop and call home. If you choose a dark-colored desk, you can leave your belongings on the desk, and set it up to be \"yours\".\n\n\n\nFor Everybody:\n\nIf you're a Basic, Six-Pack, or Lite member, if you're just dropping in for the day, or if you're a Full-Time member who likes to change things up more often, you can use any of the unoccupied light-colored work surfaces at Indy Hall. \n\nLight-colored work surfaces include the desks mixed into each workcluster, the communal tables in the ground floor gallery or 2nd floor workshop, the high-top tables in the kitchen or near the 2nd floor windows, and even the round kitchen tables if you're so inclined!\n\n\n\n\nIf you follow these guidelines, you'll begin to notice some pleasant side effects:\n\nIf you're a Full-Time member, you'll get a regular changeover of different people working next to you every day. Introduce yourself and say hi when they join you!\n\nAnd if you're a Basic, Six-Pack, or Lite member, if you're just dropping in for the day, you can be fairly certain that you're going to be sitting next to people who know their way around Indy Hall and can help you out. Get to know your full time neighbors!\n\n\nCouch-working is a-okay here!\n\n\n\nDon't be shy about working from the couches in either lounge. They can be a really nice change of pace!\n\nFood & Drink\n\nLunch & Dinner\n\nEspecially when you're new at Indy Hall, a really great way to get to know a few people is to get lunch together. Find out when the people who you're sitting near plan to get lunch, and ask if they'd mind showing you one of their favorite spots. Luckily, Old City has TONS of great food choices just within a couple of blocks. \n\n\nCommunity Tip - Three's Company (and that's a good thing)\n\nSometimes, going to lunch with a stranger can be intimidating. To take some of the pressure off (for you and for them), try going to lunch as a group of 3!\n\n\nFor choosing a lunch spot, there are dozens of options:\n\n\n\nIf you're in a hurry\n\nSome favorite quick options include Lake Blue Deli, Gianfranco's Pizzaria, Sassafras Market (not to be confused with Sassafras, the bar), and a (clean!) mediterranean/hallal cart at 4th and Market. Fork, Etc is also a popular choice for slightly more upscale takeout sandwiches and salads. \n\nIf you prefer to sit down\n\nFor a less hurried meal, or planning a lunch meeting, National Mechanics is a common staple for many Indy Hall natives. You might consider your first trip to National Mechanics, be it for lunch or happy hour, an easy rite of passage to achieve! All of their menu options are great, and they have a full bar and many craft beers on tap if it's one of those kinds of lunches. \n\nOther popular sit down lunch options include Farmacia, Continental, Khyber Pass Pub, Race St Cafe, Wedge and Fig, Han Dynasty, and Zento Sushi. There's almost any kind of food you could want within just a couple of blocks, at almost any price point. \n\nHappy Hour\n\nTODO: Write section on Happy Hour\n\nBuying groceries\n\nThe closest we've got to a proper grocery store in Old City is the Olde City Food Market on 2nd & Market. It's a bit like an oversized bodega, but they're fully-stocked with just about anything you could ask for in terms of basic groceries. Prepare to pay a little extra than the likes of Acme, though.\n\nGetting Here\n\nPublic Transportation\n\nTODO: Research all Septa lines that run near here.\n\nBiking\n\nTODO: Write help article about bike parking.\n\nParking\n\nOld City doesn't have a reputation as the easiest neighborhood to park in, but there are PLENTY of good options nearby (including some free ones!). Parking lots range from $8-15 for all day parking depending on when you enter and leave. Depending on the time of day, there's plentiful on-street parking, just make sure you read signs carefully and don't forget to set a timer to feed your meter if you're at a paid spot. Just because there isn't a meter at the spot doesn't mean it's free. If the sign says \"Pay at Kiosk\", you'll need to pay at one of the nearby digital kiosks and put a slip on your dashboard. \n\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nThe left side of 3rd Street is a tow zone during morning and afternoon rush hours.  The city enforces this and will tow you very quickly. The exact times are listed on the parking signs.\n\n\nIndy Hall members have collectively shared their best parking tips, including best lot rates, friendliest attendants and even suggested \"loops\" to drive to find free on-street parking: Community Powered Parking Tips\n\nCoworking\n\nMaking Reservations\n\nBringing Guests\n\nConference Rooms\n\nIf you're looking to grab a conference room for a certain span of time, you'll want to reserve the conference room ahead of time. While it's not required, it's an easy way to be sure that you won't be interrupted or be interrupting someone else. Chat with Adam or Karina in-person at Indy Hall, or drop them a line through info@indyhall.org. That's it!\n\nIf you need to grab a conference room for a hot minute and the room is vacant, go ahead and use it - no reservation needed. Just remember that someone may have the room booked soon after you've staked it out.\n\nThe phone booth is available to reserve though a sign-up board on the window. Make sure the date on the board is correct, write-in your name by the time(s) needed.\n\nPhone Calls\n\nDon't worry, you're not the only person here who wants/needs to use the phone from time to time. Fortunately, just about everyone here has expressed the same concern of him/herself -  we're all cognizant of one another, when it comes to our own phone conversations. \n\nPhone calls are best taken in the phone room on the 2nd floor by the kitchen. You're the best judge of how much noise you're going to make during a phone call. Casual client conversations are easy to manage at your pod. Angry shouting matches with your telecom services, not so much. \n\nGenerally, the extremities of Indy Hall are better areas for phone calls: the Workshop or the lounge on the 2nd floor, for example, tend to be just far enough away from the rest of the population to make for a calm calling experience. The center of the 2nd floor, the elevator lobby, is also a good place for a phone call.\n\nIf a conference room is unoccupied, feel free to use that space to take a call and pace around. \n\n\nCommunity Tip - Noisy Neighbors\n\nOne of the built-in features of Indy Hall is being surrounded by the constant hum and buzz of people getting things done. We love that...to a limit.\n\nIf someone nearby is a little too loud, don't hesitate to speak up and let that person know - you're likely not the only one thinking that, and the noisy person might not realize that he's bothering someone. Be confident, be kind, be honest!\n\n\nWorkspace Questions\n\nCan I bring a my own desk?\n\nActually, we're rather fond of our desks, and everyone uses the same style desk for a reason: it puts us all on the same playing field. After all, we're all here to play together - right? Our desks happen to be one of the few consistent elements here at Indy Hall, next to excellent people and awesome coffee, and we like to maintain that uniform foundation. \n\nCan/should I bring my own chair?\n\nIf you have an officer chair that you fancy over Indy Hall's public stock, bring it in and use it! In fact, we strongly encourage Full-Time members to provide their own chair to free up those available to temporary members. Everything we said about the desk, above? Toss that right out when it comes to the chairs. BYOC!\n\nCan I switch chairs between desks?\n\nSo long as you're not (permanently) borrowing a chair from a Full-Time member's desk, feel free to switch it up! Not feeling a particular chair and hoping to save someone else from the trouble? Let Adam or Karina know!\n\nMail\n\nIf you would like to have mail/packages delivered to Indy Hall, please speak to one of the core team members about it first (drop an email to help@indyhall.org).\n\nThere is one absolutely vital rule associated with receiving any form of mail here at Indy Hall: you MUST pick-up your mail. \n\nPlease track your own packages so you know when to pick them up.\n\nLockers/Storage\n\nLockers and cubbies are readily available for use, but we like to keep the lockers only for daily storage. Similar to the refrigerator, we aim to make sure that nothing gets left behind, leaving as much space as possible available to share with all members. Feel free to use a locker for the day, but try not to leave anything overnight.  \n\nMonitors\n\nAh, you've found the elephant graveyard of computer monitors. Monitors on the far right, closest to the stairs, are up for grabs to anyone at the hall. Please remember to return your monitor to its home above the lockers at the end of the day, before you leave.\n\nInternet etiquette\n\nTODO: Write section on Internet Etiquette\n\nHeat & A/C\n\nIf you think the heat or A/C needs to be adjusted, first talk to the people near you about their comfort levels. If the group agrees that a temperature change would be more comfortable, let Karina or Adam know and they can help out from there.\n\nBathrooms\n\nTODO: Write section on bathrooms. \n\nIndy Hall has 4 (four) bathrooms:\n\nRefilling the soap dispenser.\n\nNo one wants to shake the hand of the member who can't lather up after using the restroom. Help the next person out and refill the soap.\n\nWe keep soap refills in the Supply Closet on the 2nd floor (see below for location). \n\nReplacing/restocking the Toilet Paper\n\nOne of the more subtle, though absolutely critical ways we take care of each other is making sure that no one gets screwed over in terms of necessary resources being available. Trust me: EVERYONE appreciates the person who restocks the TP.\n\nWe keep TP refills in the Supply Closet on the 2nd floor (see below for location). \n\n\nCommunity Tip: Know Thy Supply Closet\n\nOur Supply Closet is located on the 2nd floor, adjacent to the North Conference Room, behind a grey door! \n\n\n\nDoes it look like we're running low on reserves of anything? Drop a line to help@indyhall.org and let us know so we can place an order.\n\n\nEmergency Exits\n\nDuring normal operations, all members and guests should enter and exit from the front door at 22 N. 3rd Street. Using the elevator or the balcony stairs for non-emergency usage can be a security risk for Indy Hall members, so please, please, please, don't use them. \n\nIn the case of an emergency, you can exit the 2nd floor by follow the red doors near the 3rd Street windows and take the stairs down from the balcony. The ground floor emergency exits are at the rear of the ground floor. Take the stairs down to the basement and follow the emergency exit signs to exit through the back of the building. \n\n\n\nKitchen\n\nCoffee\n\nImagine that you approach the coffee pot, place your cup underneath the spout, press down, and...drip drip drip. \n\nDamn. What HEATHEN would drink the last cup and not start up a fresh pot?!\n\nOkay, maybe that's a little dramatic. But only a little.\n\nMany members enjoy the rite of passage that comes with making their first pot of coffee at Indy Hall. Making a fresh pot is an excellent way to let other members know that you care about their caffiene-controlled sanity.\n\nThe big machine in the kitchen might look intimidating, but making coffee at Indy Hall is really easy to learn. \n\n\nCommunity Tip - Ask for Coffee Coaching\n\nHaving another member guide you through the steps is an easy way to make a new friend. Most members sitting in close proximity to the kitchen know what's what, when it comes to the coffee machine, or you can ask for a lesson using GroupBuzz or Hall.\n\n\nFor you self-starters, here's a guide:\n\nHold the clear container up and under the big red grinder's nozzle, making sure the container pushes gently on the trigger that allows the machine to start grinding.\n\nIf the grinder runs out of beans, we keep a stock under the coffee maker (right-hand side). \n\n\n\nNotice us running low on reserves? Email help@indyhall.org so we can place an order.\nFill grounds up to the denoted line on the container - any more than that and we'll be bonding with members while clearning an awful coffee explosion.\n\n\nPlace a single filter into the filter basket. \n\n\n\n\nCommunity Tip - Composting is Cool\n\nIf the filter basket contains used grounds, you can dump the grounds and filter into the composting can to the left of the fridge. Just don't toss the plastic filter basket itself!\n\nPour the grounds into the filter, and slide the filter basket back into the machine. Make sure it's secure!\n\n\nPress the \"Start\" toggle button, and listen for the gratifying \"woosh\" as the water begins to flow.\n\n\n\nCommunity Tip - Eyes on the cream/sugar supplies\n\nWe do our best to keep the cream and sugar supply stocked. If you notice us running low, drop a line to help@indyhall.org and we'll stock up.\n\nIf you're feeling the JFDI spirit, Lake Blue (3rd & Market, with the blue awning) sells both cream and sugar, just bring us a receipt and we'll credit your membership account.\n\n\nUsing the Fridge\n\nHere's the skinny: having a place to store perishables is pretty rad. Keeping your sandwich and iced tea cool is awesome. Sharing that space with a community of 200+ people is the opposite of rad. As a rule, we encourage members to only use the fridge for daily use. When Indy Haller is storing his/her week's meals in the same place, things get...messy. \n\nPlease be considerate of Indy Hall members, try not to leave items in the fridge overnight. \n\nBeer Fridge/Keg\n\nOur beer supply lives and dies by the mantra of TOLO: Take One, Leave One.\n\nWe like to share, here. The bottles in the beer fridge aren't the result of immaculate fermentation (though that would be a wonderfully lucrative business), and they were contributed by a thoughtful member. Enjoy the suds now, but don't forget to pay it forward for the next person\n\nCleaning\n\nPaper Towels\n\nLike the TP, you can be everyone's hero by simply replacing an empty (or near empty) paper towel roll with a full one.\n\nThe Supply Closet is upstairs on the 2nd floor, adjacent to the North Conference Room, behind a grey door with a white sign on it! Does it look like we're running low on reserves? Drop a line to help@indyhall.org and let us know so we can place an order.\n\nDishes (and the sink)\n\nTODO: Write intro for kitchen cleaning section.\n\nThe counters look messy - should I wipe them down?\n\nThat would be really great - thanks! There are paper towels on the counter and Method cleaning spray under the sink. No paper towels nor cleaning spray? Check the Supply Closet. \n\nThe dishwasher is dirty, how do I run it?\n\nThe dishwasher tablets are under the sink. Grab a tablet and put it in the dishwasher cup, located on the inside of the door. Lock the cup door and close the dishwasher door and press \"on\". Lastly, change the sign to \"clean\". Voila!\n\nThe dishwasher is clean, how do I empty it?\n\nThe kitchen is mostly labeled for where you can find things and where you can put them away.  Grab the clean items and put them away. Don't be shy to ask for help and make sure to change the sign to \"dirty\" after.   \n\nHow can I know if the dishwasher currently holds dirty or clean dishes?\n\nThe sign on the dishwasher should indicate the status of the dishes. If you're leery, pop the dishwasher open and check the inside of any mug - if you see coffee or other non-clear liquids, it ain't clean.\n\nThe trash can in the kitchen is full. What do I do?\n\nTake it out, please. Clean trash bags are located next to the coffee maker, on the floor, in a white box. The loaded trash goes behind the fake wall downstairs. To get there, you go through two doors in the back of Indy Hall downstairs. If it is locked, grab either Adam or Karina.\n\nWhat goes in the trash? What goes in the recycling? What goes in the composting?\n\nTODO: Trash stuff.\n\nContributing to How to Indy Hall\n\nYour contributions keep this guide alive. \n\nContributions can be as simple as fixing spelling/grammar, making a guide easier to understand, or as complete as drafting entirely new sections or guides.  \n\nMaking Edits via GitHub\n\nAll of the content and source code for this guide are on GitHub. \n\nIf you already know how to make edits and submit pull requests via Github, you know how this works.\n\nIf you don't, but want a lesson in using GitHub (it's not as scary as it seems, promise), post a message to GroupBuzz!\n\nSuggesting Edits via Hackpad\n\nIf you're not super tech savvy, you can draft up your edits or make suggestions on this hackpad: https://hackpad.com/VVwPFeIwpye\n\nThe clearer the instructions for applying your changes, the faster we can get them in the mix!\n\nAdd your voice\n\nWanna help make this page better?
