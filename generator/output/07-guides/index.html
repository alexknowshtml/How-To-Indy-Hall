<h1>Indy Hall Guides</h1>

<p>We avoid prescribing rules at Indy Hall, instead <a href="/2-our-virtues/">trusting people to do what's right</a>. </p>

<p>If you're ever unsure what's "right", you can fall back to these three simple guidelines: </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Look after yourself. </li>
<li>Look after each other. </li>
<li>Look after this place.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>To help you get comfortable quickly, below is a collection of <strong>member-suggested</strong> and <strong>member-contributed</strong> guides to help you take care of the things that we share. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Can't find what you're looking for, or want to add/update a How To? Get meta and check out the guide on <a href="/07-guides/#6__Contributing_to_this_Guide">contributing to to this guide</a>!</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="1__Getting_Started">1. Getting Started</h2>

<h3 id="1_1__Connecting_to_Wifi">1.1. Connecting to Wifi</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/wifi.jpg" class="photo-right"></p>

<p>Use the wireless connections named "Indy Hall 2.4gHz" and "Indy Hall 5gHz". </p>

<p>All of our wireless access points use the same password, which is included in your welcome email; ask your neighbor or one of the core team members if you’re having trouble connecting.</p>

<h4>What's the difference between the two networks available?</h4>

<p>Mobile phones and tablets may only show 2.4gHz as an option, but if you see both options you can pick whichever one has the strongest signal. 5gHz may be noticeably faster for some high-demand uses, but your milage may vary.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Community Tip - Ask a neighbor</h4>

<p>Join the "Indy Hall 2.4gHz" network if you're not sure, and ask <em>anyone</em> for the password.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="1_2__Finding_a_seat">1.2. Finding a seat</h3>

<blockquote>
<h4>Important note #1</h4>

<p>Hopefully, one of the reasons that you joined Indy Hall is to break away from the loneliness that happens when you work alone. So one of our #1 pieces of advice is: don't sit alone! </p>

<h4>Important note #2</h4>

<p>Choosing a place to sit is <strong>NOT</strong> permanent! You can swap seats with another member any time you want (you'll want to talk to them about it first, naturally) and every few months, we do a "reset" that allows people to move around, try new areas, and make new deskmates. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>With these notes in mind, you can sit almost anywhere you like!</strong> We've done a little bit of extra work to help you enjoy the time you spend coworking with us the most. Those color coded workclusters with light and dark surfaces aren't arranged that way because we wanted it to look like a checkerboard (though the look is cool, isn't it?). We do that to help you mix and mingle easier. Here's how it works!</p>

<h4>For Full Time Members:</h4>

<p><em>Full-Time members are encouraged, but not required, to find an available dark colored desk</em> to set up shop and call home. If you choose a dark-colored desk, you can leave your belongings on the desk, and set it up to be "yours".</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/full-time.jpg" alt="Full Time Setup"></p>

<h4>For Everybody:</h4>

<p>If you're a <em>Basic, Six-Pack, or Lite member</em>, if you're just <em>dropping in for the day</em>, or if you're a <em>Full-Time member who likes to change things up</em> more often, you can use any of the unoccupied <em>light-colored work surfaces</em> at Indy Hall. </p>

<p>Light-colored work surfaces include the desks mixed into each workcluster, the communal tables in the ground floor gallery or 2nd floor workshop, the high-top tables in the kitchen or near the 2nd floor windows, and even the round kitchen tables if you're so inclined!</p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/600x350" alt="TODO Photo collage of the different flex areas with people at them"></p>

<blockquote>
<h4>If you follow these guidelines, you'll begin to notice some pleasant side effects:</h4>

<p><em>If you're a Full-Time member</em>, you'll get a regular changeover of different people working next to you every day. Introduce yourself and say hi when they join you!</p>

<p><em>And if you're a Basic, Six-Pack, or Lite member, if you're just dropping in for the day,</em> you can be fairly certain that you're going to be sitting next to people who know their way around Indy Hall and can help you out. Get to know your full time neighbors!</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Couch-working is a-okay here!</h4>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/600x350" alt="TODO Photo of people working on the couches"></p>

<p>Don't be shy about working from the couches in either lounge. They can be a really nice change of pace!</p>

<h2 id="2__Food___Drink">2. Food &amp; Drink</h2>

<h3 id="2_1__Lunch___Dinner">2.1. Lunch &amp; Dinner</h3>

<p>Especially when you're new at Indy Hall, a really great way to get to know a few people is to get lunch together. Find out when the people who you're sitting near plan to get lunch, and ask if they'd mind showing you one of their favorite spots. Luckily, Old City has TONS of great food choices just within a couple of blocks. </p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Community Tip - Three's Company (and that's a good thing)</h4>

<p>Sometimes, going to lunch with a stranger can be intimidating. To take some of the pressure off (for you and for them), <strong>try going to lunch as a group of 3</strong>!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For choosing a lunch spot, there are dozens of options:</p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/600x350" alt="TODO Map of favorite spots"></p>

<h4>If you're in a hurry</h4>

<p>Some favorite quick options include Lake Blue Deli, Gianfranco's Pizzaria, Sassafras Market (not to be confused with Sassafras, the bar), and a (clean!) mediterranean/hallal cart at 4th and Market. Fork, Etc is also a popular choice for slightly more upscale takeout sandwiches and salads. </p>

<h4>If you prefer to sit down</h4>

<p>For a less hurried meal, or planning a lunch meeting, National Mechanics is a common staple for many Indy Hall natives. You might consider your first trip to National Mechanics, be it for lunch or happy hour, an easy rite of passage to achieve! All of their menu options are great, and they have a full bar and many craft beers on tap if it's one of those kinds of lunches. </p>

<p>Other popular sit down lunch options include Farmacia, Continental, Khyber Pass Pub, Race St Cafe, Wedge and Fig, Han Dynasty, and Zento Sushi. There's almost any kind of food you could want within just a couple of blocks, at almost any price point. </p>

<h3 id="2_2__Happy_Hour">2.2. Happy Hour</h3>

<p>TODO: Write section on Happy Hour</p>

<h3 id="2_3__Buying_groceries">2.3. Buying groceries</h3>

<p>We're (sadly) missing a grocery store in Old City :( Nobody's perfect, eh?</p>

<h2 id="3__Getting_Here">3. Getting Here</h2>

<h3 id="3_1__Public_Transportation">3.1. Public Transportation</h3>

<p>TODO: Research all Septa lines that run near here.</p>

<h3 id="3_2__Biking">3.2. Biking</h3>

<p>TODO: Write help article about bike parking.</p>

<h3 id="3_3__Parking">3.3. Parking</h3>

<p>Old City doesn't have a reputation as the easiest neighborhood to park in, but there are PLENTY of good options nearby (including some free ones!). Parking lots range from $8-15 for all day parking depending on when you enter and leave. Depending on the time of day, there's plentiful on-street parking, <strong>just make sure you read signs carefully</strong> and don't forget to set a timer to feed your meter if you're at a paid spot. Just because there isn't a meter at the spot doesn't mean it's free. If the sign says "Pay at Kiosk", you'll need to pay at one of the nearby digital kiosks and put a slip on your dashboard. </p>

<blockquote>
<h4>IMPORTANT:</h4>

<p>The left side of 3rd Street is a tow zone during morning and afternoon rush hours.  The city enforces this and will tow you very quickly. The exact times are listed on the parking signs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indy Hall members have collectively shared their best parking tips, including best lot rates, friendliest attendants and even suggested "loops" to drive to find free on-street parking: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yB9avVkI1N3dcAgpFSjV8Yx9Ni3L72Y2BXod-J9yPmo/pub">Community Powered Parking Tips</a></p>

<h2 id="4__Coworking">4. Coworking</h2>

<h3 id="4_1__Making_Reservations">4.1. Making Reservations</h3>

<h3 id="4_2__Bringing_Guests">4.2. Bringing Guests</h3>

<h3 id="4_3__Conference_Rooms">4.3. Conference Rooms</h3>

<p>If you're looking to grab a conference room for a certain span of time, you'll want to reserve the conference room ahead of time. While it's not required, it's an easy way to be sure that you won't be interrupted or be interrupting someone else. Chat with Adam or Karina in-person at Indy Hall, or drop them a line through info@indyhall.org. That's it!</p>

<p>If you need to grab a conference room for a hot minute and the room is vacant, go ahead and use it - no reservation needed. Just remember that someone may have the room booked soon after you've staked it out.</p>

<p>The phone booth is available to reserve though a sign-up board on the window. Make sure the date on the board is correct, write-in your name by the time(s) needed.</p>

<h3 id="4_4__Phone_Calls">4.4. Phone Calls</h3>

<p>Don't worry, you're not the only person here who wants/needs to use the phone from time to time. Fortunately, just about everyone here has expressed the same concern of him/herself -  we're all cognizant of one another, when it comes to our own phone conversations. </p>

<p>Phone calls are best taken in the phone room on the 2nd floor by the kitchen. You're the best judge of how much noise you're going to make during a phone call. Casual client conversations are easy to manage at your pod. Angry shouting matches with your telecom services, not so much. </p>

<p>Generally, the extremities of Indy Hall are better areas for phone calls: the Workshop or the lounge on the 2nd floor, for example, tend to be just far enough away from the rest of the population to make for a calm calling experience. The center of the 2nd floor, the elevator lobby, is also a good place for a phone call.</p>

<p>If a conference room is unoccupied, feel free to use that space to take a call and pace around. </p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Community Tip - Noisy Neighbors</h4>

<p>One of the built-in features of Indy Hall is being surrounded by the constant hum and buzz of people getting things done. We love that...<a href="http://cdn3.whatculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SpinalTap-11.jpg">to a limit</a>.</p>

<p>If someone nearby is a little too loud, don't hesitate to speak up and let that person know - you're likely not the only one thinking that, and the noisy person might not realize that he's bothering someone. <strong>Be confident, be kind, be honest!</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="4_5__Workspace_Questions">4.5. Workspace Questions</h3>

<h4>Can I bring a my own desk?</h4>

<p>Actually, we're rather fond of our desks, and everyone uses the same style desk for a reason: it puts us all on the same playing field. After all, we're all here to play together - right? Our desks happen to be one of the few consistent elements here at Indy Hall, next to excellent people and awesome coffee, and we like to maintain that uniform foundation. </p>

<h4>Can/should I bring my own chair?</h4>

<p>If you have an officer chair that you fancy over Indy Hall's public stock, bring it in and use it! In fact, <strong>we strongly encourage</strong> Full-Time members to provide their own chair to free up those available to temporary members. Everything we said about the desk, above? Toss that right out when it comes to the chairs. BYOC!</p>

<h4>Can I switch chairs between desks?</h4>

<p>So long as you're not (permanently) borrowing a chair from a Full-Time member's desk, feel free to switch it up! Not feeling a particular chair and hoping to save someone else from the trouble? Let Adam or Karina know!</p>

<h3 id="4_6__Mail">4.6. Mail</h3>

<p>If you would like to have mail/packages delivered to Indy Hall, please speak to one of the core team members about it first (drop an email to <a href="mailto:help@indyhall.org">help@indyhall.org</a>).</p>

<p>There is one absolutely vital rule associated with receiving any form of mail here at Indy Hall: you MUST pick-up your mail. </p>

<p>Please track your own packages so you know when to pick them up.</p>

<h3 id="4_7__Lockers_Storage">4.7. Lockers/Storage</h3>

<p>Lockers and cubbies are readily available for use, but we like to keep the lockers only for daily storage. Similar to the refrigerator, we aim to make sure that nothing gets left behind, leaving as much space as possible available to share with all members. Feel free to use a locker for the day, but try not to leave anything overnight.  </p>

<h3 id="4_8__Monitors">4.8. Monitors</h3>

<p>Ah, you've found the elephant graveyard of computer monitors. Monitors on the far right, closest to the stairs, are up for grabs to anyone at the hall. Please remember to return your monitor to its home above the lockers at the end of the day, before you leave.</p>

<h3 id="4_9__Internet_etiquette">4.9. Internet etiquette</h3>

<p>TODO: Write section on Internet Etiquette</p>

<h3 id="4_10__Heat___A_C">4.10. Heat &amp; A/C</h3>

<p>If you think the heat or A/C needs to be adjusted, first talk to the people near you about their comfort levels. If the group agrees that a temperature change would be more comfortable, let Karina or Adam know and they can help out from there.</p>

<h3 id="4_11__Bathrooms">4.11. Bathrooms</h3>

<p>TODO: Write section on bathrooms. </p>

<p>Indy Hall has 4 (four) bathrooms:</p>

<h4>Refilling the soap dispenser.</h4>

<p>No one wants to shake the hand of the member who can't lather up after using the restroom. Help the next person out and refill the soap.</p>

<p>We keep soap refills in the Supply Closet on the 2nd floor (see below for location). </p>

<h4>Replacing/restocking the Toilet Paper</h4>

<p>One of the more subtle, though absolutely critical ways we take care of each other is making sure that no one gets screwed over in terms of necessary resources being available. <strong>Trust me: EVERYONE appreciates the person who restocks the TP.</strong></p>

<p>We keep TP refills in the Supply Closet on the 2nd floor (see below for location). </p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Community Tip: Know Thy Supply Closet</h4>

<p>Our Supply Closet is located on the 2nd floor, adjacent to the North Conference Room, behind a grey door! </p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/350x100" alt="TODO Map with arrow to Supply Closet"></p>

<p><strong>Does it look like we're running low on reserves of anything?</strong> Drop a line to help@indyhall.org and let us know so we can place an order.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="4_12__Emergency_Exits">4.12. Emergency Exits</h3>

<p>During normal operations, <em>all members and guests</em> should enter and exit from the front door at 22 N. 3rd Street. Using the elevator or the balcony stairs for non-emergency usage can be a security risk for Indy Hall members, so please, please, please, don't use them. </p>

<p><em>In the case of an emergency</em>, you can exit the 2nd floor by follow the red doors near the 3rd Street windows and take the stairs down from the balcony. The ground floor emergency exits are at the rear of the ground floor. Take the stairs down to the basement and follow the emergency exit signs to exit through the back of the building. </p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/600x350" alt="TOD Map with arrows pointing to exits"></p>

<h2 id="5__Kitchen">5. Kitchen</h2>

<h3 id="5_1__Coffee">5.1. Coffee</h3>

<p>Imagine that you approach the coffee pot, place your cup underneath the spout, press down, and...drip drip drip. </p>

<p><strong>Damn.</strong> What HEATHEN would drink the last cup and not start up a fresh pot?!</p>

<p><em>Okay, maybe that's a little dramatic. But only a little.</em></p>

<p>Many members enjoy the rite of passage that comes with making their first pot of coffee at Indy Hall. Making a fresh pot is an excellent way to let other members know that you care about their caffiene-controlled sanity.</p>

<p><strong>The big machine in the kitchen might look intimidating, but making coffee at Indy Hall is <em>really easy to learn</em>.</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Community Tip - Ask for Coffee Coaching</h4>

<p>Having another member guide you through the steps is an easy way to make a new friend. Most members sitting in close proximity to the kitchen know what's what, when it comes to the coffee machine, or you can ask for a lesson using GroupBuzz or Hall.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>For you self-starters, here's a guide:</h4>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Hold the clear container up and under the big red grinder's nozzle, making sure the container pushes gently on the trigger that allows the machine to start grinding.</p>

<p>If the grinder runs out of beans, we keep a stock under the coffee maker (right-hand side). </p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/350x150" alt="TODO Photo/gif of Step 1"></p>

<p>Notice us running low on reserves? Email <a href="mailto:help@indyhall.org">help@indyhall.org</a> so we can place an order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fill grounds up to the denoted line on the container - any more than that and we'll be bonding with members while clearning an awful coffee explosion.</p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/350x150" alt="TODO Photo/gif of Step 2"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place a single filter into the filter basket. </p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/350x150" alt="TODO Photo/gif of Step 3"></p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Community Tip - Composting is Cool</h4>

<p>If the filter basket contains used grounds, you can dump the grounds and filter into the composting can to the left of the fridge. <strong>Just don't toss the plastic filter basket itself!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour the grounds into the filter, and slide the filter basket back into the machine. Make sure it's secure!</p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/350x150" alt="TODO Photo/gif of Step 4"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press the "Start" toggle button, and listen for the gratifying "woosh" as the water begins to flow.</p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/350x150" alt="TODO Photo/gif of Step 5"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<h4>Community Tip - Eyes on the cream/sugar supplies</h4>

<p>We do our best to keep the cream and sugar supply stocked. If you notice us running low, drop a line to <a href="help@indyhall.org">help@indyhall.org</a> and we'll stock up.</p>

<p><strong>If you're feeling the JFDI spirit</strong>, Lake Blue (3rd &amp; Market, with the blue awning) sells both cream and sugar, just bring us a receipt and we'll credit your membership account.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="5_2__Using_the_Fridge">5.2. Using the Fridge</h3>

<p>Here's the skinny: having a place to store perishables is pretty rad. Keeping your sandwich and iced tea cool is awesome. Sharing that space with a community of 200+ people is the opposite of rad. As a rule, we encourage members to only use the fridge for daily use. When Indy Haller is storing his/her week's meals in the same place, things get...messy. </p>

<p>Please be considerate of Indy Hall members, try not to leave items in the fridge overnight. </p>

<h3 id="5_3__Beer_Fridge_Keg">5.3. Beer Fridge/Keg</h3>

<p>Our beer supply lives and dies by the mantra of TOLO: Take One, Leave One.</p>

<p>We like to share, here. The bottles in the beer fridge aren't the result of immaculate fermentation (though that would be a wonderfully lucrative business), and they were contributed by a thoughtful member. Enjoy the suds now, but don't forget to pay it forward for the next person</p>

<h3 id="5_4__Cleaning">5.4. Cleaning</h3>

<h4>Paper Towels</h4>

<p>Like the TP, you can be <strong>everyone's hero</strong> by simply replacing an empty (or near empty) paper towel roll with a full one.</p>

<p>The Supply Closet is upstairs on the 2nd floor, adjacent to the North Conference Room, behind a grey door with a white sign on it! Does it look like we're running low on reserves? Drop a line to help@indyhall.org and let us know so we can place an order.</p>

<h4>Dishes (and the sink)</h4>

<p>TODO: Write intro for kitchen cleaning section.</p>

<h4>The counters look messy - should I wipe them down?</h4>

<p>That would be really great - thanks! There are paper towels on the counter and Method cleaning spray under the sink. No paper towels nor cleaning spray? Check the Supply Closet. </p>

<h4>The dishwasher is dirty, how do I run it?</h4>

<p>The dishwasher tablets are under the sink. Grab a tablet and put it in the dishwasher cup, located on the inside of the door. Lock the cup door and close the dishwasher door and press "on". Lastly, change the sign to "clean". Voila!</p>

<h4>The dishwasher is clean, how do I empty it?</h4>

<p>The kitchen is mostly labeled for where you can find things and where you can put them away.  Grab the clean items and put them away. Don't be shy to ask for help and make sure to change the sign to "dirty" after.   </p>

<h4>How can I know if the dishwasher currently holds dirty or clean dishes?</h4>

<p>The sign on the dishwasher should indicate the status of the dishes. If you're leery, pop the dishwasher open and check the inside of any mug - if you see coffee or other non-clear liquids, it ain't clean.</p>

<h4>The trash can in the kitchen is full. What do I do?</h4>

<p>Take it out, please. Clean trash bags are located next to the coffee maker, on the floor, in a white box. The loaded trash goes behind the fake wall downstairs. To get there, you go through two doors in the back of Indy Hall downstairs. If it is locked, grab either Adam or Karina.</p>

<h4>What goes in the trash? What goes in the recycling? What goes in the composting?</h4>
