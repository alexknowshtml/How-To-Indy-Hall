<h1>Start Here</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/images/alex.png" height="100" width="100" style="float:left;margin-right:20px;"></p>

<p>Hi. I'm Alex Hillman, the co-founder of Indy Hall, and I want to welcome you to our community. First and foremost, thanks for accepting our invitation to be a member of Indy Hall. We're glad you're here.</p>

<p>When I started down the path of creating Indy Hall, it wasn't because I needed a place to work - even though I loved the freedom and flexibility to work from anywhere, <strong>I was lonely working by myself.</strong> If you're here for similar reasons (and there's a good chance you are), we're already helping each other.</p>

<p>Many years later, Indy Hall has evolved into an unusual, exceptional, unpredictable, and wonderful place - but you probably already know that, because you've made the decision to be a part of our community.</p>

<p>One of the things that's always been remarkable to me about Indy Hall's growth and evolution, from our initial 20 members to the 200+ member community we are today, is that <strong>the culture of this community is still as strong as it was the first day, if not stronger for our size.</strong></p>

<h2 id="1__How_to_use_this_Guide">1. How to use this Guide</h2>

<p>Even more remarkable is that we've accomplished this without a written "rulebook" for our members. </p>

<p>I've often joked that part of the reason we don't have a rulebook is because "I like being able to change things as we go". There's more than a bit of truth in that, and in fact, I believe that we <strong>need</strong> to be able to change things as we go. Once we write down an answer, people tend to stop exploring new possibilities (accepting things as status quo is something that <a href="/02-our-virtues/">Our Virtues</a> guide us away from). </p>

<p>But one of the other things that has allowed Indy Hall to evolve successfully is listening with an open mind. While reading <a href="http://indyhall.groupbuzz.io/topics/91-a-culture-of-take">this thread on our discussion list</a>, my eyes were opened to the need for more "guidance systems" to help Indy Hall members feel comfortable and confident in our community. </p>

<h4>A new kind of challenge</h4>

<p>While creating this guide, we asked ourselves the question: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>How do we create a resource that gives answers, but also explains how we came up with those answers and encourages members to explore new possible answers?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The result is a guide that is a mix of story, dialogue, introspection, ideas, and tools to help you be an excellent community member at Indy Hall - and ultimately, in any setting where you gather, meet, work, and collaborate.</p>

<h2 id="2__Make_It_Better">2. Make It Better</h2>

<p><strong>Most importantly, this guide is co-created by you - the members of Indy Hall.</strong></p>

<p>You're invited - and encouraged - to <strong>push boundaries</strong>, <strong>explore new options</strong>, <strong>find new (and better!) answers</strong> to any questions about how to succeed as a member, and how to help this community succeed. </p>

<p>You can even contribute directly to the guide with additional/revised text, photos, stories, links, blog posts, etc. Read our how to section on <a href="/07-guides/#6__Contributing_to_How_to_Indy_Hall">How To Contribute to this Guide</a> to find out more.</p>

<h4>This is a map, not a manual. We need your contributions.</h4>

<p><strong>This document isn't written in stone.</strong> While every line is there for a reason, every line is also an invitation to talk about it. We warmly welcome conversation, debate, and experimentation. </p>

<p>If you want to share with the entire community, start a <a href="http://indyhall.groupbuzz.io/">new discussion on GroupBuzz</a>. </p>

<p>If you prefer to start the conversation privately, you can email <a href="mailto:help@indyhall.org">help@indyhall.org</a> to reach Alex, Adam, and Karina directly.</p>

<h3 id="2_1__Look_for_TODOs">2.1. Look for TODOs</h3>

<p>Throughout these pages, you may notice a section or feature that is clearly incomplete. Often, it will be denoted by a line prefixed "TODO:" followed by a description of what's expected to follow. </p>

<p>If you find a TODO that you'd like to complete and contribute, go for it! Our guide for <a href="/07-guides/#6__Contributing_to_How_to_Indy_Hall">making contributions</a> will show you a handful of easy ways to turn a TODO into a DONE.</p>
