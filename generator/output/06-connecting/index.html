        <p><img src="/assets/images/hall.jpg"></p>
        
        <p>Log in, spend a few minutes reading some of the existing discussions to get a feel, and then <strong>introduce yourself!</strong> Say a bit about what why you joined Indy Hall, what things you're interested in (don't limit yourself to work topics, people love sharing personal interests and hobbies, too). </p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <h4>Community Tip - What to post (and what not to post)</h4>
        
        <p>It's probably easier to mention posts that aren't successful or efficient: if it reads like a blog post, it likely won't be read well by members. Stay personal. Keep it real.</p>
        
        <p>Remember the difference between asking a friend for help and posting a recruiting email. <strong>Job listings</strong> are best to the "Gig Swap" room in Hall. </p>

        <h2 id="2__Meeting_Members_Offline">2. Meeting Members Offline</h2>
        
        <p><em>Especially</em> when you're new, Indy Hall can be a lot to take in, and it's not always obvious where to start. </p>
        
        <p>If you're overwhelmed, remember, <strong>you don't have to meet everybody at once.</strong> Stay focused on meeting one or two people at a time. </p>
        
        <p>When you sit down next to people you don't know, make eye contact and say hi, give them your name and ask for theirs. You can ask questions like, "how long have you been a member?" or "Any tips for a newbie like me?". </p>
        
        <p>Everyone here is interesting (even if they don't think so)! </p>
        
        <p><strong>Be patient. Be curious. Be friendly. Be honest.</strong></p>
        
        <h2 id="3__Meeting_Members_at_Events">3. Meeting Members at Events</h2>
        
        <h4>Weekly &amp; Monthly Events</h4>
        
        <p>There are things to do with other Indy Hall members Indy Hall every week, including Working @ Night Owls &amp; Dinner Club, joining in the conversation at Member Lunches, and Indy Hall Running Club, and B-Team trips to the comic book shop.   </p>
        
        <p>Monthly events include our ever-popular Show &amp; Tell, various art openings, and happy hours. Over the course of the year, we also host several large parties that are open to the public. We're always looking for something to celebrate!   </p>
        
        <p>You can find out about our planned event schedule by joining our Meetup Group: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/IndyHall/events/calendar/">http://www.meetup.com/IndyHall/events/calendar/</a></p>
        
        <h4>"Everyday" and impromptu events</h4>
        
        <p>You don't have to wait for an event to show up on the calendar. Every day at Indy Hall can be an event! </p>
        
        <p>Because they're not on the calendar, you do need to keep your eyes open for improtpu gatherings in the kitchen, lounge, gallery, and other common areas. Also, keep an eye on GroupBuzz discussions &amp; Hall chat for announcements. </p>
