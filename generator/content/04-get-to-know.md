# Friendly (and helpful) Faces

There are literally HUNDREDS of Friendly Faces at Indy Hall. One thing this community isn't short on is smiles. 

If you're just getting started, you might not be sure who you can turn to for help. In this part of the guide, we'll profile some people that you should **absolutely** get to know, but please please please please please don't stop with them.

> 
> **One of my dreams is:** add a punch-line to any of the jokes that I've only half-written. At least one of them will be reasonably funny - eventually. Probably.

## "Regulars"

Indy Hall can feel a bit like "Cheers" sometimes - and like the show, we've got a cast of characters who have been around long enough to know a *little bit more*  about Indy Hall than the average coworker. These folks have helped out a little extra, know lots of other members well, and know lots of "hidden tips" and stories about Indy Hall.

Getting to know even a couple of these members can be a fast-track to connecting to the community. Pick one and say hi.

#### Sean Martorana

#### Johnny Bilotta

#### Kara LaFleur

#### Dana Henry

#### Rob Epler

#### Eric Steele

#### Nicole Fryer

#### Parker Whitney
