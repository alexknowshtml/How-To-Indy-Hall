# Friendly (and helpful) Faces

There are literally HUNDREDS of Friendly Faces at Indy Hall. One thing this community isn't short on is smiles. 

If you're just getting started, you might not be sure who you can turn to for help. In this part of the guide, we'll profile some people that you should **absolutely** get to know, but please please please please please don't stop with them.

> **Before I joined Indy Hall, I:** produced copy for social media campaigns at a local agency, wrote 50% of several jokes before abandoning the premise for each.

> **One thing I like to teach people is:** "Friends are friends because they've discovered how much they have in common. Opponents, adversaries, and foes are friends too, who have not yet discovered this." [via Notes from the Universe]
> 
> **One of my dreams is:** add a punch-line to any of the jokes that I've only half-written. At least one of them will be reasonably funny - eventually. Probably.
