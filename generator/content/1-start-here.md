Hi. I'm Alex Hillman, the co-founder of Indy Hall, and I want to welcome you. First and foremost, I want to thank you for accepting our invitation to be a member of Indy Hall. When I started down the path of creating Indy Hall, it wasn't because I needed a place to work - even though I loved the freedom and flexibility to work from anywhere, **I was lonely working by myself.**

Many years later, Indy Hall has evolved into an unusual, exceptional, unpredictable, and wonderful place - but you probably already know that, because you've made the decision to be a part of our community.

One of the things that's always been remarkable to me about Indy Hall's growth and evolution, from our initial 20 members to the 200+ member community we are today, is that **the culture of this community is still as strong as it was the first day, if not stronger for our size.**

## How to use this Guide

Even more remarkable is that we've accomplished this without a written "rulebook" for our members. 

I've often joked that part of the reason we don't have a rulebook is because "I like being able to change things as we go". There's more than a bit of truth in that, and in fact, I believe that we **need** to be able to change things as we go. Once we write down an answer, people tend to stop exploring new possibilities (accepting things as status quo is something that [Our Virtues](/2-our-virtues/) guide us away from). 

But one of the other things that has allowed Indy Hall to evolve successfully is listening with an open mind. While reading [this thread on our discussion list](http://indyhall.groupbuzz.io/topics/91-a-culture-of-take), my eyes were opened to the need for more "guidance systems" to help Indy Hall members feel comfortable and confident in our community. 

### A new kind of challenge

So creating this guide posed a new challenge: 

> **How do we create a resource that gives answers, but also explains how we came up with those answers and encourages members to explore new possible answers?**

The result is a guide that is a mix of story, dialogue, introspection, ideas, and tools to help you be an excellent community member at Indy Hall - and ultimately, in any setting where you gather, meet, work, and collaborate.

### This is a map, not a manual. We need your contributions.

**Most importantly, this guide is co-created by you - the members of Indy Hall.**

You're invited - and encouraged - to **push boundaries**, **explore new options**, **find new (and better!) answers** to any questions about how to succeed as a member, and how to help this community succeed. 

You can even contribute directly to the guide with additional/revised text, photos, stories, links, blog posts, etc. Read our how to section on [How To Contribute to this Guide](/7-how-to/) to find out more.

## Questions? Comments? Ideas?

Let's keep the conversation going. 

If you want to share with the entire community, start a [new discussion on GroupBuzz](http://indyhall.groupbuzz.io/).
