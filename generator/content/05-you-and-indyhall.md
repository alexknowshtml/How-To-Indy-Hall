# You and Indy Hall

## What you have in common

The members [a.k.a. the people, coworkers, groups and community] of Indy Hall cannot be pigeon holed by job titles or industry sectors. **We have a wider curiosity.**

We are a gathering of people finding a way of working better together (both offline and on) focused on inspiration, participation and learning through doing. Anything can happen, the environments and space(s) change.

The participants of Indy Hall share a fundamental optimism, a spirit of liberty in action, encouragement and enlightenment. Where many people would see problems, Participants see opportunities for making things better, and they wish to take on a personal responsibility for making things happen.

We work to inspire anyone to help everyone.   
We use creative intelligence to solve real problems.

## How to be a kick ass community member

Being a great member of our community happens a bit differently than in some other  settings. It's more organic, less mechanical. This also means that often, it takes time. 

Trust is one of the primary currencies at Indy Hall, and it plays a big role in being a kick-ass community member.

#### Here's an observation for consideration:

> * In order to help, someone needs to be ready to accept that help. 
> * In order for people to be ready to accept help, they need to be able to be willing to be vulnerable enough to ask for help.
> * Being vulnerable requires establishing trust in the source. People are drawn to trusted sources, not authoritative sources
> * The difference between establishing authority and trust, in our experience, is being able to show some vulnerability yourself.

So with this chain of events in mind, sometimes the best way to be a PROVIDER of help is to first establish trust by receiving help rather than offering it. There are lots of ways to do that, of course, but the most effective ways tend to be small and personal rather than a blast to the entire community. 

If a large portion of your participation in the community at Indy Hall will be online, you may find it effective earn trust by listening and engaging in conversations (all the while, remembering the difference between authority and trust mentioned above) rather than trying to jump-start them without that foundation of earned trust.

> #### Community Tip - Start Small
> 
> Try framing it this way: instead of trying to help the "members of Indy Hall", focus on one building relationship at a time. Indy Hall is a special place where we try to make it easier to build the relationships before transactions.


## Your Responsibilities
Indy Hall is quite different from your average working environment. Among the differences, we are **not** a serviced office, and that's not an accident. 

Being a member of Indy Hall comes with the benefits of sharing ideas, information, support, and of course our coworking clubhouse. 

#### In exchange, here is a non-exhaustive  the expectations that we have of all Indy Hall members, in taking care of each other:

> * Participation can be an extreme sport. If you break or lose it, you should replace it.
> * Your equipment & professional liability is your responsibility.
> * Cleaning up after yourself, emptying bins & recycling when they are full is a shared responsibility. We work together to keep the space we're proud of presentable. **Let a core team member know if you're not sure where empty bags are, or where trash goes.**
> * Do leave the spaces as you found them, or better than you found them (artwork and decoration is welcome).
> * Anyone who behaves in an manner that is destructive to the space or other participants may be asked to leave.
> * Be responsible and respectful with your internet usage. No bit-torrent or PrOn.
> * Respect other peoples personal and business privacy, confidentiality, safety, property and data. **If you're not sure, ask them.**
> * The last remaining keyholder must ask a non-keyholder to leave at the end of the night, and non-keyholders must respect keyholders' personal schedules.
