# Values & Virtues

Indy Hall's membership is both expansive and diverse. Most people here do *not* work together on the same projects or businesses. **So what brings us together as a community?**

When we look beyond the work that we do and the titles we hold, we start to notice the experiences we've lived and the passions we hold.
 
Bula, an Indy Hall member since September of 2009, once said to me:

> "Indy Hall has people from a breath of experiences, from all walks of life. 
>
> Here, you get people...and not just what they're doing now, and today.
> You get people and their **histories**".

And if we challenge ourselves to look even deeper than those experiences and passions, we find what *really* glues us together: the core values and virtues that we practice as individuals and as a community. 

It's not easy, but we do our best to think about these values and virtues every day. Even at an operations level, we use the values and virtues as tools for making decisions about how Indy Hall runs.

## Our Values

We subscribe to the 5 core values shared by the [global Coworking movement](http://coworking.com): Sustainability, Accessibility, Openness, Collaboration, & Community.

Below is a series of essays by Indy Hall co-founder Alex Hillman explaining how we think about and practice these core values at Indy Hall. 

> These essays have been adapted for the "How To Indy Hall guide", but each essay in its original form can be found on his [personal blog](http://dangerouslyawesome.com/2011/10/coworking-core-values-series-translated/), and have even been translated into other languages, including French and Portuguese!

### Sustainability

**Sustainability is a loaded word.**

The "green" benefits of Indy Hall are obvious: resource sharing is inherently green, as is commute reduction. 

But the reality is that, in a modern society, does "being a responsible eco-citizen" belong in the list of top line core values? Efficiency is a *benefit*, but not a core value. Striving for efficiency is a good goal, but it's rarely a source of greatness.

**So if sustainability doesn't mean "going green", what does it mean?**

Sustainability, in my mind, is about making sure that whatever you're doing **can be done for as long as it needs to be done**. 

#### A Farmer Once Told Me
I had the pleasure of seeing [Joel Salatin speak at TEDxMidAtlantic in 2009](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T9UaP1AsMI "TEDxMidAtlantic - Joel Salatin - 11/5/09 - YouTube"), and remember being struck by what this farmer had to say. I highly recommend his 15 minute talk.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>A community that can feed itself is free. A community that cannot feed itself is not. It&#39;s that simple.</p>&mdash; Joel Salatin (@JoelSalatin) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoelSalatin/statuses/95569133772615680">July 25, 2011</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Joel's tweet above is about food. But if you read past the fact that he's talking about food, what he's really talking about is nourishment.

#### How Indy Hall became sustainable

In the early days of Indy Hall, Geoff and I were talking about how to take the momentum we'd built and turn it into the coworking space *that everybody wanted*. 

One of the important insights Geoff drove home was that we needed to be able to sustain ourselves – our membership should support costs as well as provide room for growth – or else it wouldn't worth building the infrastructure in the first place. It wouldn't be sustainable.

We looked at for profit and non-profit models, and determined that in order for us to achieve that goal, for us to be sustainable, being a for-profit business provided for us most effectively for two reasons: speed and agility. As a for-profit LLC, we could stay lightweight and agile, but still remain benevolent and community focused. 

**More importantly,** we didn't (and still don't) have to answer to investors or banks or anybody besides ourselves. 

***Most* importantly,** we could answer to the most important people: *our community.* We could focus on growing in a way that depends on no one except for the people who benefit most from the resources we rally.

After all, community that isn't able to nourish itself lives in dependency of whomever is providing for it, and therefore is not only not free, but not sustainable.

Indy Hall is a community that is able to provide for itself and doesn't exclude itself from external sources of nourishment – but it remains free, sustainable, and independent.

#### The people and businesses we support will live as our reflections.

I firmly believe that the longer Indy Hall is able to do what it does best, the healthier the people and businesses who work from it will be. We see our members often gain sustainability by:

> * understanding your identity, [who you are](http://dangerouslyawesome.com/2011/02/the-importance-of-lines/) (not just who you aren't).
> * participating in a support network for [growth](http://dangerouslyawesome.com/2010/11/a-story-of-discovering-potential/).
> * engaging in the [open and honest exchange](http://dangerouslyawesome.com/2011/07/a-hall-pass-for-bureaucracy-code-for-america-philadelphia/) of information and ideas.
> * practicing humility taught by [not having to be the smartest kid in the room](http://dangerouslyawesome.com/2011/06/a-coworking-parable-the-game-of-chess/).
> * reintroducing [ natural relationship formation](http://dangerouslyawesome.com/2011/07/i-dont-think-were-solving-a-cubicle-problem/) into business deal workflow.

These are all things that are necessary to "heal the world", just as much as the elements of "going green" are.

If we're healing the planet for people who aren't living and working sustainably, what's the point?

### Accessibility

**We trust people to select themselves in.** One of the unique elements of Indy Hall is that anybody who can work from anywhere can become a member of this community. You don't even need to physically be here to be a part of it. A key element here is self-selection.

If you think about it, it's actually pretty remarkable. Indy Hall is one of the few places in the world where every single person in the room is there because they chose to be. An environment composed of willing, self-selected participants is a remarkably positive and productive place to work, as you'll find out talking to anybody who works or hangs out here. I think that many people who cite unusual productivity levels from working at Indy Hall are actually feeling the benefits of a) choosing for themselves where to work for the day and b) being surrounded by others who choose where they work for the day.

Over the last 6 years, we've had many people surprise us. Maybe their experience level seemed lower than average. Maybe their social skills needed a little work. Maybe they were shyer. Maybe they were boisterous. Maybe they were snarky. Maybe they were know-it alls. In time, most of those attributes vanished. They started to be themselves, instead of the person they thought they had to be. And in the best cases, they improved themselves over time. 

Indy Hall, as a melting pot, allows all of these extremes to normalize on their own. We trust that when people have to actually deal with other people instead of have managers, mediators, or human resources solve their problems for them – most of the time, things work themselves out.

**We trust people to select themselves out.**
In the early days of Indy Hall, we were excited to be meeting anybody who wanted to be around. Not because we were desperate to fill our office, but because we were genuinely excited to be finding more and more people who were awesome.

Then one day, somebody not so awesome showed up. I knew personal stories about this person, and decided that I didn't want that person around Indy Hall. I talked it over with Geoff, who was able to look at the situation without my biases:

> "If we don't let in one person because you don't like them, what kind of precedent does that set for everybody else? We want Indy Hall to be a place where anybody – even people we don't know yet – can feel welcome, be a part of and contribute to something great."

**My commitment to the core value of accessibility was being challenged.**

I had to trust that this person would make the right decision for themselves: either they would change their behavior from what I knew to have happened in the past (a positive outcome), or that they'd leave on their own when they realized they wouldn't get what they wanted (also a positive outcome).

If they were truly not aligned with our community as I expected, the latter was the most likely result.

Inside of a couple of months, that person simply stopped showing up on their own.

This interaction has happened more than once. On only two occasions in six years have we had to ask somebody to leave.
 
#### Balance is key

The core value of accessibility relies on both of these dynamics to be in balance. Indy Hall's philosophy remains committed to this core value, the remarkable outcomes and benefits that make us more than a "trendy way to share real estate" start to take form.

When everything shakes out, we're glad to be part of a unique environment where we can trust people to surprise us in a positive way.

### Openness

The core value of openness may seem redundant after reading about accessibility, but the nuanced difference is an important one.

I think Chris Messina says it best [in this interview](http://therexpedition.com/2010/11/rex-in-his-own-words-chris-messina/),

> Openness is unfortunately one of those words that's become somewhat geriatric, losing its teeth and forgetting what it means...
> 
> When I think of openness I also think of biology and the human body. The human body is an "open system" and thrives because of its openness. The human body is constantly exchanging things it values little for things it values more. Whether you're talking about oxygen and CO2 or nutrients and waste, the body cycles – value in and waste excreted. **It requires openness to live.**

The fact that Chris and other early coworking founders realized that by making coworking "open", that it could evolve into something much larger than any one of them could control – and that would ultimately be the best thing for the idea.

Openness comes into practice in two key ways at Indy Hall - freedom and forkability.

#### Freedom 
Indy Hall embodies freedom and independence. We represent choice, the ultimate freedom. Coworking Seattle's about page says...

> Coworking is about making the personal choice to work along side other people instead of in isolation.

#### "Forkability"

"Forkability" is the ability to take the "source" of one project and use it to begin a new project. In software, the source is code. Here at Indy Hall, the source is lessons learned, ideas executed, and of course our core values and virtues.

I've described Indy Hall as a "blank canvas" an office. 

> "What happens when you share basic office amenities only – desks, chairs, power, internet, meeting rooms, bathrooms – and let the people decide what's most important to them?"

Many interesting things happen, but the most important is the new possibility of **making it you own**.

The stories I tell of the cool things that happen at Indy Hall aren't things that Geoff or I go out of our way to make happen. The stories I tell of the cool things that happen at Indy Hall are all stories of our community, our members, who continually build on top of the basic infrastructure we share and maintain together.

The "innovation" that happens at Indy Hall is the result of an experience that it affords everyone here the opportunity to create new solutions to the problems they have rather than relying on the old solutions that haven't been working as well.

As a member of Indy Hall, you 're encouraged to "fork" Indy Hall, especially when the things you decide to do benefit other members in addition to yourself.

### Collaboration

I like to remember [this post about collaboration from Derek Neighbors](http://derekneighbors.com/2010/08/you-cant-do-collaboration-without-being-a-collaborator/) of [Gangplank](http://gangplankhq.com/) in Arizona:

> **"You can't do collaboration, you have to be a collaborator."**

I find this idea poignant for a number of reasons – not the least of which is that it fits my own mental model for coworking so well. Coworking works because it throws away so many of the bad habits we've learned and puts the focus back on the people again.

**Collaboration isn't something you do.**   
**Collaboration is the by-product of being a better collaborator.***

#### Trust & High Contact
We talk a lot about trust, here. Indy Hall allows for there to be a focus on the formation of trust and deeper relationships between coworkers, because office politics, hierarchies, and succession planning are removed from the equation.

Going one step further, we create opportunities for people to interact in a "high contact" environment. The serendipitous nature of a our clubhouse means that people are often spending far more face time with each other than in an office where people only interact when they need to.

#### Learning by Example
Indy Hall is a great place to learn how to be a better collaborator. 

We believe that our members are collaborators, not customers. Members who work together – not just with each other but with the community and space itself – tend to have build deepest bonds with the community. 

#### Learning to Ride a Bike

**Here's a parable:** 

Do you remember learning to ride a bike? Can you imagine learning to ride a bike alone? 

It's a painful series of trials and errors. While you might've watched somebody else do it, you're likely to fall and scrape your knee on your first try. 

Teaching somebody to ride a bike, however, requires them to be a good collaborator more than it requires them to be a good teacher. They need to guide you, support you, and help you find your own "balance". It requires that the new rider trusts their instructor/collaborator, and spend a fair amount of time together.

The collaborators that work with, in and from Indy Hall are very similar. Good collaborators earn trust first. They spend a lot of face time together with their peers. They don't instruct, but instead guide, support, and help you find your own way.

In the best collaborator relationships, it's a two way street – each person has the ability to provide that experience for the other at some point in their time together.

**Indy Hall provides one of the best natural environments for this to happen.**

### Community

I think community is my personal favorite of the coworking core values, and perhaps one of the most misunderstood or most often taken for granted.

It's easy to make mistakes around the idea of community. Experts in the field of sociology can't even agree on a definition, Wikipedia mentions that by the 1950′s there were nearly 100 "discrete definitions". Instead of getting mired in clinical discussion, there's one thing that matters:

**It's about the people.**

In the context of coworking, though, I believe that a focus on community means putting emphasis on people, their interactions, and the relationships that form between them *above everything else*. At Indy Hall, every decision we make considers each other as members, and the opportunities to interact with one another.

#### We > Me
We [organize events and develop experiences](/06-connecting/) that encourage each other to explore our shared interests in and outside of work. Show and Tell, Lunch & Learns, and Happy Hours provide a spectrum of formal and informal opportunities to step away from the desk and get to know another coworker.

We share rituals and experiences that allow new members to join our tribe and develop camaraderie.

We [broadcast our favorite places to hang out](/07-guides/#2__Food___Drink) outside of our clubhouse so that you can easily gather with other members on your own.

We attend and support other events and initiatives together (and we try to avoid rolling as a "click"), both enhancing them with the sense of "togetherness" that we bring but also showing the uninitiated that our "togetherness" is accessible to them .

**We learn, share, grow, play, experiment, celebrate together. We commiserate and console each other as well.**

#### Our clubhouse is a tool
Our coworking space is just that – a space. **It's not a community without people in it.**

Geoff and I think about [Coworking as a "clubhouse"](http://dangerouslyawesome.com/2008/09/the-importance-of-a-clubhouse/), and I think that language is more accurate of a description than "office". But it's important to remember that in order for a clubhouse to be useful, a club – a community – should be in need of a home.

#### You don't own a community, you belong to a community.

I often say that I absolutely love that I can come to Indy Hall as a member, far more than I care about coming to Indy Hall as an owner. The oft-forgotten truth is that coworking space owners can get the same benefits from coworking as the members do, mostly due to the fact that we ourselves are (or should be) good community members as well.

#### Communities of Trust

If relationships between members are like tendons, then trust is the the muscle that makes a community strong and healthy.

We start by trusting each other, and knowing that sets a stage where trust is a valued part of being in this community. When you start a relationship off on one where you don't trust others, you can't ever expect them to trust you, either.

#### No two communities are identical

I wouldn't ever encourage somebody to replicate Indy Hall, nor do I think it's really replicate-able. Instead, I urge people to learn from the lessons we've learned, share some of our ideas, but interpret them to fit their community .

I personally think that the coolest thing is that communities, like the people in them, have personality. Squelching that personality is a waste – instead, we embrace it. 

## Our Virtues

> *Note: the concepts and contents of this section about our virtues originated in this post on [Alex's Blog - The Virtues of Indy Hall](http://dangerouslyawesome.com/2012/04/the-virtues-of-indy-hall/).*

#### Eudaimonia

The Greeks had a word - **eudaimonia** - which translates to "the good life". More specifically, they described the good life as:

> "...rich with relationships, ideas, emotion, health and vigor, recognition and contribution, passion and fulfillment, and great accomplishment and enduring achievement."

#### Arête

The Greeks had another word - **Arête** - which translates into "virtues".

> Virtues are patterns in how we behave - habits, choices, interactions, etc - that when practiced and matured bring the "side effect" of eudaimonia. 

**But virtues don't automatically result in "the good life."**

Think of it like going to the gym: if you go to the gym to lose weight, you're likely to be disappointed or fall off the wagon if the weight loss doesn't show up as fast as you want.

If you go to the gym to be healthy, your motivators come from deeper inside of you, and you're more likely to push through the harder parts of the workout routine as you make progress with becoming healthier.

Weight loss will be the byproduct of becoming healthier. **The good life is a byproduct of practicing Arête every day.**

#### Practicing Arête requires a transformation in perspective:

> * From vision to ambition.
> * From mission to intention.
> * From strategy to constraints.
> * From objectives to imperatives.

### Our Ambition

An **ambition** replaces a "vision" – and it answers the question "why are we here?" 

More specifically, an ambition is meant to define the kinds of returns we will create, and who will benefit. The more genuine the value is, the greater the ambition. 

We earn bonus points for **better**, rather than bigger.

> Our ambition is to make Philadelphia (and ultimately the world) a better place to make a living doing what you love, creating space for trusting, lasting relationships between people **before** they need to work together.


### Our Intentions

An **intention** is an action required to achieve an ambition. 

How do you improve things for the people you interact with? What interactions make sure the ambition is being fulfilled? We seek to:

  > ...help unlikely groups of likeminded people form relationships.   
  > ...focus on people and their interactions, and the formation of relationships.   
  > ...help people tell the stories of the experiences they have in Philadelphia.   
  > ...trust people to do the right thing.   
  > ...guide people to being good citizens of Indy Hall and of Philadelphia.   
  > ...support people in their goals of building businesses to last, in Philadelphia and for Philadelphia.   

### Our Constraints

Constraints are the actions which must **not** be done. Constraints exist to avoid things that do damage to the value being created. We must never:

  > ...do anything against our community's interest.   
  > ...focus on desks or square footage.   
  > ...create something only because we think we're supposed to.   
  > ...accept the status quo.   
  > ...accept a "no" at face value.   
  > ...compromise our core values.   
  > ...prioritize a transaction before a relationship.   

### Our Imperatives

Imperatives are the things that must be done daily. They're specific, focused actions that help achieve the intentions and ambitions. We must always:

  > ...keep people at the center of every action, interaction, and decision.   
  > ...welcome new community members, and make it clear that Indy Hall is theirs, not just ours.   
  > ...always look for a way to say "yes".   
  > ...teach others in our immediate and neighboring communities how we operate.   

#### Do It Yourself

If you're running a business, from startup to Fortune 500, you can practice Arête.

If you're developing a community, from a family to a city, you can practice Arête.

If you're creating, from art to technology, you can practice Arête.

If you're working, alone or as part of a team, you can practice Arête.

If your goals include doing things that are authentic and meaningful, you must practice Arête.

**What are your ambitions, intentions, constraints, and imperatives?**
